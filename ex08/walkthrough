do while(true) loop that checks what we write

"auth *" -> auth gets malloc and sets its value to the rest of the input (specified here with *)
"service*", service gets strdup (specified here with *)
"reset" frees auth
"login" -> auth_address + 0x20 == 0 -> writes "Password:\n"
        -> auth_address + 0x20 != 0 -> runs "/bin/sh"


each malloc call sets memory to last malloc + 0x10 bytes
so we simply need to do "auth ", "service 1234567890", "service" and "login"
"auth " to create auth_address
the two "service" to put a char != '\0' in the memory address at auth_address + 0x20
"login" to get inside the shell
we can cat level8/.pass
