main:

four malloc
two strcpy
fgets
fread
puts

ltrace ./level7 1 2
we find that the first and third malloc are address
the second and fourth the values of those addresses

2 strcpy calls

m function not called that prints address of fgets call

each malloc address is 16 bytes apart from the next one

first strcpy call copies av[1] in the 1st value
we can overflow and modify the 2nd address to the one
whose value is called in the puts.got call (0x08049928)

2nd strcpy copies av[2] inside the 2nd value,
we can just put the address of the m() function (0x080484f4)
so that it is called during the got call

offset to overflow is 20 
but we can work with it:

./level7 `python -c 'print ("a" * 20 + "\x28\x99\x04\x08")'` `python -c 'print ("\xf4\x84\x04\x08")'`
